Why concurrency is faster 
Improved I/O performance which allows programs to handle multiple I/O operations (like network requests or file access) simultaneously, preventing the program from being blocked while waiting for a response.

Concurrency helps utilize CPU cores more effectively by allowing multiple tasks to be run concurrently, even if theyâ€™re not strictly CPU-bound. 

And help helping responsiveness by not blocking the main thread, it can keep the user interface responsive even while preforming lengthy operations in the background.
